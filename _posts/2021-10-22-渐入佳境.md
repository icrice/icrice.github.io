---

â€‹	After half an month,I was gradually adapted to the life in the university.I knew how to corretly get a break.To be honest,it is more easier than lives in high school.There is lots of time to do mang things,such as build a blog.And I can paint everytime that do not to worry teacher would come to your sides and tore the paper.What the most important is having enough time to make a 

good dream,which is a big wish in my highschool.
